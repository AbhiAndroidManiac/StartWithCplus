# Line Breaks and Escape Sequences in C++

In C++, both `\n` and `endl` are used to break lines. However, `\n` is more commonly used.

## What is `\n`?

The newline character `\n` is an **escape sequence**. It forces the cursor to move to the beginning of the next line on the screen, resulting in a new line.

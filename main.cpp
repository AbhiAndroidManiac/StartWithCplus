    ðŸ”¸ Common Uses:
    1. Accessing global variables when local ones have the same name
        int value = 10;       // global
        int main() {
        int value = 5;    // local
        cout << ::value;  // prints 10 (global)
        }

    **/
    //std::cout << "The value is happening";
    //ScopeResolutionOperator scopeResObject;
    //scopeResObject.demonstrateScopeResolution();


    //printing number variable
    std::cout << 3 << "\n";
    /**
        ways to insert new lines
        "\n"
        now this can be placed with as following
    **/
    //way one
    std::cout << "A first new line \n";

    std::cout << "I am learning c++" << std::endl;



    return 0;
